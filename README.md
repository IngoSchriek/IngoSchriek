I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student at the **Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC)** and a member of the **Hawa** team at [**LabSEC/UFSC**](http://www.labsec.ufsc.br/), where I'm dedicated to creating and maintaining high-security systems for the Brazilian digital certificate market. My work involves everything from the conception of new features to ensuring our systems adhere to the strictest security and compliance standards.

### Projects

My work is centered on the digital certification ecosystem, where I develop everything from end-user applications to low-level libraries for communicating with cryptographic hardware.

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| **Hawa** | Software for issuing and managing the lifecycle of digital certificates. Responsible for validating, issuing, and signing certificates, generating CRLs, and maintaining an OCSP service for validity verification. |
| **Ybyra** | A project that facilitates the issuance and management of attribute certificates. This technology allows assigning roles, permissions, or qualifications to a digital identity (e.g., proving a person's job title within a company). |
| **AmanajÃ©** | A Java library for communicating with HSMs via the KMIP protocol. The goal is to standardize and simplify how applications manage cryptographic objects (keys, certificates) on secure hardware. |
| **pkcs11-psc** | An interface based on the PKCS#11 standard for performing key management and digital signatures with the security provided by HSMs, as part of a system that implements a Trusted Service Provider (TSP). |
